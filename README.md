# COVID-19 Data Analysis on 70 Countries

This project provides an analysis of COVID-19 cases across 70 countries using data from Wikipedia. The data is analyzed with Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, and visualized with bar charts.

## Features
- **Data Analysis**: Processed with Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
- **Visualizations**: 
  - Bar charts showing cases for all countries in two parts.
  - Top 20 most affected countries.

## Files
- `matplotlibdata.xlsx`: Contains the dataset collected from Wikipedia.
- `Covid_based_graph.py`: Python script for analysis and visualization.

## Instructions
1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine from GitHub.
2. **Install the required dependencies**: Make sure to install `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `pandas` using a package manager like `pip`.
3. **Add the dataset**: Ensure that the `matplotlibdata.xlsx` file (containing the COVID-19 data) is placed in the same directory as the `main.py` script, or provide the path to the file in the code.
4. **Run the project** by executing the `main.py` script in your Python environment to generate the visualizations.
